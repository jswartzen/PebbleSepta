Septa App for Pebble

This is in the very early stages of development. The goal for the final product is as follows:

This is a Pebble.js application for the original Pebble watch. It allows you to specify a "Home" and "Work" station. Based on
your current location, it will automatically show you the status of the next three trains from the closest Septa Regional Rail station to your home. If the closest station is your home station, then it will show you the status of the next three trains to your "Work" station.
