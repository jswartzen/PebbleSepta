## *Septa App* for Pebble

Copyright &copy; John L. Swartzentruber. All rights reserved.

This is a Pebble.js application for the original Pebble watch. When completed, it will allow you to specify a "Home" and "Work" station. Based on your current location, it automatically shows you the status of the next three trains from the closest Septa Regional Rail station to your home. If the closest station is your home station, then it will show you the status of the next three trains to your "Work" station. You can toggle the destination station between "home" and "work" using the up or down buttons.
